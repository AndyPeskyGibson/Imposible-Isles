# Welcome to Impossible Isles 
**No personal data is ever collected, only your score will be sent  to the leaderboards.

A daily map-like puzzle for everyone. Just place the tiles according to simple rules to make a map and score.

But every day the Imp resets the world - a new pack of tiles, dealt in a new order all day. A new starter map and new wildcard. Even the Imp’s path is the same all day so there’s no luck, it’s all down to your skill at placing each tile to score the maximum. Check your map score against everyone else on the daily leaderboard.

And certain tiles hold secret bonus scores if you can work out how to place them.
